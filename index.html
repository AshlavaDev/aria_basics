  <h1>A Few Commonly Used ARIA Labels And Roles</h1>
  <p>This pure HTML file contains some of the most commonly used ARIA roles and labels. The order is done to mimic the possible order presented on a proper webpage, such as menus and close buttons on top.</p>

  <!-- Given that Semantic HTML tags exist, menus and child elements are often not used. Here a div, rather than a nav, is used -->
  <div role="navigation" aria-label="Menu">
    <ul role="menu">
      <li role="menuitem"><a href="#" aria-label="Home">Home</a></li>
      <li role="menuitem"><a href="#" aria-label="About">About</a></li>
      <li role="menuitem"><a href="#" aria-label="Home">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Buttons can have aria labels if there is no description of what the button does between the tags. For example, a label would be unnecessary if instead of X it said the word Close -->
    <button aria-label="Close">X</button>
  </div>

  <!-- The img role and the aria-label are interesting, as they allow for groupings of several images into one larger "image" that is designed to act like one image -->
  <!-- Also included is the aria-labelledby, which is useful for using other elements displayed on the page as the aria label such as captions -->
  <div role="img" aria-labelledby="images-label">
    <img src="https://picsum.photos/200" alt="The first random image">
    <img src="https://picsum.photos/200" alt="The second random image">
    <p id="images-label">This would have a description of the overall images</p>
    <p>The images, randomly generated by <a href="https://picsum.photos/" target="_blank">Lorem Picsum</a> will be the same due to seeding synchronously</p>
  </div>

  <!-- ARIA is useful for forms and different children elements, but form html such as input types cover roles well -->
  <form aria-label="Form using ARIA">

    <!-- The inputs do not ARIA roles as the type reflects the use -->
    <label for="name">Full Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" aria-label="User's Name">

    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" aria-label="User's Email">

    <input type="checkbox" id="checkboxer" aria-label="Checkbox">
    <label for="checkboxer">ARIA?</label>

    <!-- The button does not have the button role as the semantic html element covers it -->
    <button type="submit" aria-label="Login">Login</button>
  </form>

  <!-- The progress bar is something I under-utilize a lot but has some ARIA attached, such as all values being screenreadable -->
  <div role="progressbar" aria-label="Progress Bar" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100" aria-valuenow="75">
    <span>75% Done (and won't change without more elements)</span>
  </div>

  <!-- Like the progress bar, the aria-hidden and aria-expanded require javascript (or typescript) to be functional -->
  <button aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapse-content">Toggle Content</button>
  <div id="collapse-content" aria-hidden="false">
    <p>This is the content that can be expanded or collapsed.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- The aria-describedby is similar to aria-labelledby but is more long form -->
  <p id="button-description">This button, if hooked up to some javascript, would perform some kind of action, but really is only there right now to show how ARIA describedby works. Labelledby or semantic regular html is preferred</p>
  <button aria-describedby="button-description">Click Me For Things</button>

  <p>For now this will be all the ARIA things I will show, since there is a lot but also a huge amount is not needed if you use semantic html. (I will probably make a blog post about that too)</p>
